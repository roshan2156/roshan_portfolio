  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <article class="project">
    <h3>Accident Avoidance Detection System While Driving</h3>
    <p>Built a simple safety system using an Arduino microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles ahead of a moving vehicle. When an obstacle is detected within a certain distance, a buzzer sounds an alert to warn and prevent accidents. The system is tested on a small self-moving toy car powered by a rubber band or a sloped ramp.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Created an affordable and easy-to-build accident prevention prototype that can be used for educational purposes and basic IoT demonstrations.</p>
    <p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> Arduino UNO, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, Buzzer, Breadboard, Rubber Band or Gravity Ramp Mechanism</p>

  <article class="project">
    <h3>Shopping Website</h3>
    <p>This Shopping Website is a complete e-commerce platform developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, allowing users to browse products, add items to the cart, and proceed through the checkout process up to the payment step.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Promotes e-commerce learning and practical implementation for students and developers.</p>
    <p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> HTML, CSS, PHP, MYSQL</p>
  </article>

  <article class="project">
    <h3>MindScope: Introvert or Extrovert Identifier</h3>
    <p>Developed a psychology-based desktop application that predicts whether a person is an introvert or extrovert based on a series of behavioral input questions. The project uses a simple scoring algorithm to analyze the user's choices and visualizes the result using a bar chart.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Provided an interactive way to understand personality tendencies through self-assessment and Served as a foundational psychology + AI/ML integration concept suitable for further enhancement (e.g., using ML models).</p>
    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, matplotlib, Google Colab, Windows Command Prompt, Conditional Logic, Data Visualization</p>
  </article>

  <article class="project">
    <h3>GitHub Pages Deployment (Portfolio Website)</h3>
    <p>Deployed a personal portfolio website using GitHub Pages, a free hosting service for static websites provided by GitHub. Managed the entire deployment process including repository creation, file uploads, and branch configuration to publish a professional, responsive portfolio site without needing backend infrastructure.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Enabled easy and cost-free online presence to showcase skills, projects, and experience. Improved accessibility for recruiters and collaborators by hosting a live website with direct links to projects. Demonstrated proficiency in version control, repository management, and continuous deployment workflows, enhancing professional credibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages, HTML, CSS</p>
